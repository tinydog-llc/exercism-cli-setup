# Exercism CLI Setup Script for Linux

This *should* install Exercism CLI on any Linux system. However, this has been specifically created to allow us to set it up in Docker containers to be used in VSCode devcontainers. It may work for you, it may not.

## Instructions

Run the following command:

`bash -c "$(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tinydog-llc/exercism-cli-setup/main/install.sh)"`
